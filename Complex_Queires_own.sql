  1.Select the details of employees with minimum salary on their designation

2.Select the oldest employees from each department, Add an additional column and give them a 10% bonus  of their salary

3.Display all employee details  along with the count of reportees their manager has.

For example :Neena (employee_id 101) has manager steven  and steven has 14 reportees show Neenaâ€™s details along with 14

4.Details of all employees along with an additional column which shows average of salary partitioned by Designation but only for employees that were hired before 12 years
